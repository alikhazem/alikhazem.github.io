<h1 id="removing-google-from-my-life">Removing Google from my life</h1>
<p>As with many big tech companies, Google has gotten more and more intrusive over the time that it has been growing in popularity. It started as a search engine, and now has a full suite of applications that all work together to lock the user into it's ecosystem. However, the largest Google product besides it's search engine, is YouTube. YouTube started as just a place to find some interesting videos and toutorials that acted as a tool for many. Now it is a major time suck that keeps users locked into a cycle of mindless scrolling and consuming. This has been amplified with the addition of YouTube shorts (A TikTok clone) that plays on the reudced attention span of humans in the age of social media. YouTube shorts are difficult to disable and are often showcased just under the reccommended videos on YouTube's home page. This means that people going onto YouTube for a single purpose, are often bombarded with videos that draw them into a long night of binge-watching mindless content.</p>
<p>This led me to decide to cut out YouTube from my life. However, when I say &quot;Cut out&quot;, I do not intend to totally remove all the channels and videos I watch. I simply want to move away from countless distractions shown on the YouTube front page. This is relatively easy to do. I have been using RSS feeds for a few years now to keep up with particular blogs and websites that I follow. I intend to move to a system whereby all the channels I watch and want to keep watching, are simply updated through an RSS feed. This will ensure that I cannot fall into consuming content that I did not intend to. This also means that I will have to be more cautious with how I pick the channels I wish to watch. I do not want my RSS feed to be filled with garbage and brainless content that does not add anything to my life. I currently watch around 15 channels consistently, with another 5 that I only watch when they upload specific videos. I have already converted my entire &quot;watch later&quot;, which has been collecting videos for around 1 year, to local mp4 files that I can watch whenever I want on my computer.</p>
<p>There are still other services that I use from Google. This includes Gmail and Google Calendar. I haven't been using Google Calendar actively, but I have considered moving back to it for scheduling my exams. Therefore, I think that if I was to remove Google from my life, it should be done correctly. Over the next few weeks, I will move all my emails from Gmail, into a local file to keep for reference, and then subsequently delete my Gmail. Baring in mind that I haven't been using Gmail for personal emails.</p>
<h1 id="alternatives-to-google-services">Alternatives to Google services</h1>
<p>Many people are locked into the Google ecosystem, I am glad to say that I only use a select few of Google's services. Here are some &quot;Google alternatives&quot; that I can think of off the top of my head. <em>I do use alot of the programs listed below</em></p>
<p><em>Search Engine</em></p>
<ul>
<li>DuckDuckGo</li>
<li>SearX</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Google Chrome</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox</li>
<li>Brave</li>
<li>Ungoogled Chromium</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Google Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Joplin</li>
<li>Vim Wiki</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Google Calendar</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Calcurse</li>
</ul>
<p><em>YouTube</em></p>
<ul>
<li>PeerTube</li>
<li>youtube-dl</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Gmail</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Self Hosted Email</li>
<li>Guerilla Mail</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Google Docs</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Libre Office</li>
<li>Groff</li>
<li>LaTeX</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the many hundreds of applications that can be used instead of Google. I have already switched to many of these alternatives over the years and honestly, the alternatives are often better than the service provided by Google. I will be taking the next few weeks to achieve my goal of becoming 100% google independent by switching to sane, efficient, and <em>free</em> alternatives that align with my workflow.</p>
