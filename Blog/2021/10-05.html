<h1 id="how-i-do-my-computing">How I do my computing</h1>
<p>Over the last year and a half, I have really tweaked the way I do computing to suit my every need. The onset of Covid-19 and the insuing lockdowns aided in this process. I found myself pretty much on the computer all the time. Whether it be online school, the work that I got post the school day, and recreational use. Therefore, the time spent on my computer should be time that allows me to be as &quot;productive&quot; as possible. This led me to establish a few &quot;guidelines&quot; that I wanted out of a particular workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Ease of use</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Control</li>
<li>Battery life (Not as important)</li>
<li>Stability</li>
<li>Freedom</li>
</ul>
<p>As a life-long Windows user, the choice was obvious; continue using Windows. However, with every update, Windows 10 became more and more slow, junky, and felt less and less smooth on my relatively high end hardware. This led me to explore alternative operating systems. I stumbled upon/tried many variants of the GNU/Linux operating system, such as, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian, Arch Linux, Fedora, and even an experiment with Gentoo Linux. However, the endless nights distro-hopping ended when i stumbled on Void Linux. This is my daily driver and has given me the best desktop experience I have ever had. It is rock solid stable, whilst also being a rolling release, allowing me to install the latest and greatest software. It should be said that there are a lot of specifics that I would like to save for another article with regards to Void Linux, but I can comfortably say that it is truly an amazing operating system.</p>
<p>However, Void Linux alone does not meet every use case for me. Gaming is an issue that can not really be solved for me by GNU/Linux. My hardware is simply incompatible with any other operating system besides Windows. That is why I still have a Windows partition that I use to play any game my heart desires. The main reason for my hardware's lack of compatibility is that it has a lot of propriatary firmware. This paired with the fact that fan control, power plans, and warranty support, are controlled by a single application on my laptop called &quot;Dragon Centre&quot;. There is an open source alternative in the making, however the project is not yet mature enough to be used full time. For reference, some basic specs of my hardware are listed below:</p>
<p>MSI GF65 Thin</p>
<ul>
<li>intel core i5 10300</li>
<li>Nvidia Geforce 1660ti</li>

<h1 id="will-i-change-anything">Will I change anything?</h1>
<p>For the most part, I am very happy with what I currently have going with regards to computing. If I was to ever change anything about my computing, it would be the reduction of propriatary software in my workflow. Switching from things such as Windows would be great once the firmware and software for my specific machine is available on GNU/Linux. I use propriatary software more out of convenience than anything else, but I would like to use <em>free</em> alternatives when they become available.</p>
<p>One more thing that I think I will change out is my display environment. I would like to switch to a more holistic experience through the use of a full fledged desktop environment. Due to my old distro-hopping, I am very much aware of what I like and what I don't like. If I was to switch to a desktop environment, it would be XFCE.</p>
